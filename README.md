# Basketball_Stats_tool

This is a program that reads from the "constants" data (`PLAYERS` and `TEAMS`) in `constants.py`. This data is translated into a new collection, and the fields have been changed according to the directions for analysis purposes.

The following is displayed for each team when the program is run:
Team's name as a string
Total players on that team as an integer
The player names as strings separated by commas
number of inexperienced players on that team
number of experienced players on that team
the average height of the team
the guardians of all the players on that team (as a comma-separated string)
